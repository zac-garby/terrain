# terrain

Terrain can be generated by adding together a series of random sine waves. In two dimensions, one of the sine waves will look like `Asin(Bx + Cy + D)`, where `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are randomly chosen constants. A lot of these waves are added together to create something which looks vaguely like terrain. In the Mathematica (`Terrain.nb`) implementation, the parameters are chosen based on a normal distribution, but in the python implementations they are chosen uniformly in a range.
